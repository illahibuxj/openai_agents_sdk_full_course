## 🤖 What is an Agent?

An **Agent** is an AI program that can **think**, **decide**, and **act** to complete a specific task.  
Each agent usually has a **specific goal or role**.  
Agents can also **collaborate**, passing tasks between each other to solve complex problems — this is known as **multi-agent collaboration**.

## ⚔️ Difference Between Agent and Chatbot

| Feature             | 🤖 **AI Agent**                                                         | 💬 **Chatbot**                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**         | Designed to **think, decide, and perform tasks**                        | Mainly made to **chat or answer questions**              |
| **Intelligence**    | More **advanced** — can plan, use tools, and solve complex problems     | **Limited** to pre-set responses or simple conversations |
| **Autonomy**        | Works **independently**, can take actions without constant input        | Needs **user input** to respond                          |
| **Examples of Use** | Managing workflows, searching data, booking meetings, analyzing reports | Customer support, FAQs, simple Q&A                       |
| **Interaction**     | Can talk, act, and **collaborate with other agents**                    | Can only **talk** with users                             |
| **Technology**      | Uses frameworks like **OpenAI Agents SDK** or **Swarm**                 | Uses simpler rule-based or NLP systems                   |

🧩 **In short:**  
A **Chatbot only talks**, while an **Agent can think, act, and perform tasks** on its own.

## 🧰 What is SDK?

**SDK** stands for **Software Development Kit**.  
It’s a collection of **tools, libraries, and documentation** that helps developers build software or apps easily.  

The **OpenAI Agents SDK** enables developers to create and manage **AI agents** efficiently — without needing to build everything from scratch.  
<br>

🧩 **In short:**  
An **SDK** is a ready-made **toolkit** for developers to quickly build apps or connect to a platform.
