Swarm was an experimental framework by OpenAI that made it easy to manage and connect multiple AI agents working together on different tasks.

Think of it like a team of specialists:

 Each agent has its own job (like billing, support, or data analysis).
 Handoffs let one agent pass the task to another when needed — just like a team member forwarding an email to the right person.

This system made AI teamwork smooth, scalable, and easy to test.



From Swarm → to Agents SDK

OpenAI later improved Swarm into a production-ready tool called the OpenAI Agents SDK.
It uses the same ideas but adds more power and tools for developers to:

 Manage multiple agents easily
 Automate complex workflows
 Make agents work together efficiently

So, Agents SDK is the upgraded version of Swarm — ready for real-world use.



Anthropic’s Design Patterns (Used in Agents SDK)

Anthropic’s Design Patterns are common methods or structures used to build smart and effective AI agents.

Main Anthropic Design Patterns

1. Prompt Chaining:
Break a big task into small steps.
Each step’s output becomes the next step’s input.

2. Routing:
Send a task to the right agent based on what needs to be done.

3. Parallelization:
Let multiple agents work at the same time to finish faster.

4. Orchestrator–Workers:
One main agent (orchestrator) gives tasks to other agents (workers) and manages them.

5. Evaluator–Optimizer:
One agent checks the work of others and gives feedback to improve performance.


# In short:

 Swarm = experimental framework for multi-agent systems.
 Agents SDK = upgraded, real-world version of Swarm.
 Design patterns = smart ways to make agents cooperate efficiently.
