# 🧠 **What is Swarm (_جھنڈ, مجمع_)?**
<br>

## 🚀 **Introduction**

**Swarm** was an *experimental framework* by **OpenAI** that made it easy to **manage and connect multiple AI agents** working together on different tasks.

Think of it like a **team of specialists**:

- 🧾 Each **agent** has its own job (like billing, support, or data analysis).  
- 🔄 **Handoffs** let one agent pass the task to another — just like a team member forwarding an email to the right person.  

✅ This system made AI teamwork **smooth, scalable, and easy to test**.

## 🔁 **From Swarm → to Agents SDK**

Swarm is now replaced by the OpenAI Agents SDK, which is a **production-ready** evolution of Swarm.  
It uses the same ideas but adds more **power** and **developer-friendly tools**.

With the **Agents SDK**, developers can:

- ⚙️ **Manage multiple agents easily**  
- 🤖 **Automate complex workflows**  
- 🤝 **Make agents work together efficiently**

💡 **In short:** The **Agents SDK** is the **next generation** of **Swarm**, designed for **real-world use**.

## 🧩 **Anthropic’s Design Patterns (Used in Agents SDK)**

**Anthropic’s Design Patterns** are **common methods or structures** used to build **smart and effective AI agents**.  
They act as **blueprints** for organizing agent collaboration.

<br>


### 🧱 **Main Anthropic Design Patterns**

1. **🪜 Prompt Chaining**  
   - Break a big task into **small steps**.  
   - Each step’s **output becomes the next step’s input**.  
<br>

2. **🧭 Routing**  
   - Send a task to the **right agent** based on what needs to be done.  

<br>

3. **⚡ Parallelization**  
   - Let **multiple agents work at the same time** to finish faster.  

<br>

4. **🎯 Orchestrator–Workers**  
   - One **main agent (orchestrator)** gives tasks to **other agents (workers)** and manages them.  
<br>


5. **🔍 Evaluator–Optimizer**  
   - One agent **checks the work** of others and gives **feedback** to improve performance.
